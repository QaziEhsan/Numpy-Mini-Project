# Numpy-Mini-Project
I analyzed a dataset with attributes like age, education, race, and income, adding extra data for depth. I examined age distribution to see if the population is mostly young or old, assessed racial diversity to identify minority groups, checked if work-hour policies for those over 60 are followed, and explored the link between education and income.
